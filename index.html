				<h2>H Clicker</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>H clicker is my second clicker game, this one started as a joke, 
				but I quickly found it to be a great way of improving my coding. 
				This game is a lot like my first game, except the code is a whole 
				lot nicer and there are features which I wouldn't know how to implement before this.</p>

				<h2>OwO Clicker</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>My first game and my first website with effort put into it.
				At the time, I was super happy with this, and I kept rushing to add new
				menus or new options, not caring about how it looked. This led to
				my code being borderline unreadable and unoptimized. While I
				speak badly of this, I'm still proud of what I managed to accomplish,
				this was very good for a first project.
